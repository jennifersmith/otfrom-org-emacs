* Jen's emacs config

** Fullscreen shortcut

Full screen for productivity... or because I have installed a fabulous theme.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x f") 'toggle-frame-fullscreen)

#+END_SRC

** Start emacs-server

Emacs tends to run for weeks at a time for me (with all the 10000 buffers I want to access ready to go).

*** TODO Get emacsclient upgraded and working properly 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(server-start)

#+END_SRC

** Enabling shift-select

Other forms of select just don't stick. This is like habit. So it gotta stay.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(setq org-support-shift-select 1)

#+END_SRC

** Shortcuts

Helpful to be able to get straight to my config. Weird naming but whevs. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(defun jump-to-config ()
"Jump to the config orgmode file I use to configure emacs"
(interactive)
(find-file "~/.emacs.d/org/config.org"))

#+END_SRC

** Custom settings location

Avoid polluting init.el with custom settings - this can be a temporary stop-gap before they wind up in here or just grow if I can't be bothered to do anything with them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
(load custom-file)
#+END_SRC
