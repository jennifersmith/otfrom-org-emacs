* Introduction

  This is a gutted version of the org-mode-emacs config that @otfrom put together: https://github.com/otfrom/otfrom-org-emacs

  I am gradually building back everything I need, but I realised to grok emacs a little better that it might be good to start from bare-bones and work up to all the modifications. Plus I don't appear to be doing a great deal of Clojure these days.

* Progress

** Step one: nuke everything

Starting by 'commenting out' all the original stuff by some crafty string replacement. As I carry on I realise that I know bugger-all emacs shortcuts really. Gratuitous use of whereis required.
